# 20-Year-Class-PReunion
Four friends, a road trip, and a looming 20th year high school reunion. A NaNoWriMo novel.

For Jessica, coming up with the perfect wedding gift was the easy part. Delivering her one-of-a-kind gift will require a lot of cargo space and little help from her friends.

For Cara, a time-wasting road trip was the last thing she needed. But she does owe Andrew a very big favor, and she's not going to let Jessica down this time.

As for Andrew, catching a ride to their high school reunion sounded like just the ticket. Heck, it beats playing computer games in a dark room while not looking for a job.

And Buzz? He's a man with a polka-dotted bus and nothing tying him down. Yet.
